## Mad Scientist's Lab

Hic sunt dracones or, in plain English, Here be dragons.

Just a bunch of code snippets I made over years. Some are useful, some are not so useful.

## List of available files:
- backup-todoist.sh - Script to download the latest Todoist backup available
- ci.py\* - A micro-CI pipeline. I made a long time ago, IIRC, as practical exam for a job opportunity. They're incomplete and don't work as expected. Some day may be I will finish them.
- deb2tgz - A script to convert Debian packages to Slackare ones. I don't know if still works because I don't use Slackware anymore over a decade.
- edit-html.sh - A script to compose emails with Markdown and send as HTML (with a signature) when using (Neo)mutt.
- lock.sh - A context-aware script to lock the session I made to use with i3/console. I will add support for Wayland (Sway) in the future.
- suicide_script.sh - The suicide script. It will execute just once.
